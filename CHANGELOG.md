## [v0.17.1] - 2023-04-21

This release fixes HTTP graceful shutdown for the server.

### [Fixed]
- server: fix http graceful shutdown  ([#1090](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/1090))

## [v0.17.0] - 2023-04-17

This is a significant release and the major breaking changes to be aware of are:

### Server backpressure

This release changes the server to be "backpressured" and it mostly concerns subscriptions.
New APIs has been introduced because of that and the API `pipe_from_stream` has been removed.

Before it was possible to do:

```rust
	module
		.register_subscription("sub", "s", "unsub", |_, sink, _| async move {
			let stream = stream_of_integers();

			tokio::spawn(async move {
				sink.pipe_from_stream(stream)
			});
		})
		.unwrap();
```

After this release one must do something like:

```rust
	// This is just a example helper.
	//
	// Other examples:
	// - <https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/blob/master/examples/examples/ws_pubsub_broadcast.rs>
	// - <https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/blob/master/examples/examples/ws_pubsub_with_params.rs>
	async fn pipe_from_stream<T: Serialize>(
		pending: PendingSubscriptionSink,
		mut stream: impl Stream<Item = T> + Unpin,
	) -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
		let mut sink = pending.accept().await?;

		loop {
			tokio::select! {
				_ = sink.closed() => break Ok(()),

				maybe_item = stream.next() => {
					let Some(item) = match maybe_item else {
						break Ok(()),
					};

					let msg = SubscriptionMessage::from_json(&item)?;

					if let Err(e) = sink.send_timeout(msg, Duration::from_secs(60)).await {
						match e {
							// The subscription or connection was closed.
							SendTimeoutError::Closed(_) => break Ok(()),
							/// The subscription send timeout expired
							/// the message is returned and you could save that message
							/// and retry again later.
							SendTimeoutError::Timeout(_) => break Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Subscription timeout expired")),
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}


	module
		.register_subscription("sub", "s", "unsub", |_, pending, _| async move {
			let stream = stream();
			pipe_from_stream(sink, stream).await
		})
		.unwrap();
```

### Method call return type is more flexible

This release also introduces a trait called `IntoResponse` which is makes it possible to return custom types and/or error
types instead of enforcing everything to return `Result<T, jsonrpsee::core::Error>`

This affects the APIs `RpcModule::register_method`, `RpcModule::register_async_method` and `RpcModule::register_blocking_method`
and when these are used in the proc macro API are affected by this change.
Be aware that [the client APIs don't support this yet](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/issues/1067)

The `IntoResponse` trait is already implemented for `Result<T, jsonrpsee::core::Error>` and for the primitive types

Before it was possible to do:

```rust
	// This would return Result<&str, jsonrpsee::core::Error>
	module.register_method("say_hello", |_, _| Ok("lo"))?;
```

After this release it's possible to do:

```rust
	// Note, this method call is infallible and you might not want to return Result.
	module.register_method("say_hello", |_, _| "lo")?;
```

### Subscription API is changed.

jsonrpsee now spawns the subscriptions via `tokio::spawn` and it's sufficient to provide an async block in `register_subscription`

Further, the subscription API had an explicit close API for closing subscriptions which was hard to understand and
to get right. This has been removed and everything is handled by the return value/type of the async block instead.

Example:

```rust
	module
		.register_subscription::<RpcResult<(), _, _>::("sub", "s", "unsub", |_, pending, _| async move {
			// This just answers the RPC call and if this fails => no close notification is sent out.
			pending.accept().await?;
			// This is sent out as a `close notification/message`.
			Err(anyhow::anyhow!("The subscription failed"))?;
		})
		.unwrap();
```

The return value in the example above needs to implement `IntoSubscriptionCloseResponse` and
any value that is returned after that the subscription has been accepted will be treated as a `IntoSubscriptionCloseResponse`.

Because `Result<(), E>` is used here the close notification will be sent out as error notification but it's possible to
disable the subscription close response by using `()` instead of `Result<(), E>` or implement `IntoSubscriptionCloseResponse` for other behaviour.

## [v0.15.1] - 2022-07-29

This release fixes some incorrect tracing spans.

### [Fixed]
-  [Bug Fix] - Incorrect trace caused by use of Span::enter in asynchronous code [#835](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/835)

## [v0.15.0] - 2022-07-20

v0.15.0 is a breaking release. The main changes are:

- It's now possible to apply resource limits to subscriptions as well as regular calls.
- We now allow trait bounds to be overridden in the proc macros. See `examples/examples/proc_macro_bounds.rs` for examples.
- We've tidied up the subscription API, removing the `PendingSink` concept (you can still manually accept or reject a sink, but otherwise it'll be accepted automatically if you send a message down it) ([#799](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/799)).
- Our logging `Middleware` trait has been split into `HttpMiddleware` and `WsMiddleware` to better capture the differences between the two. if you use custom middleware, you'll need to implement one or the other trait on it depending on your used transport method ([#793](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/793)). We also provide params and the method type to middleware calls now, too ([#820](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/820)).
- We've consistified the API for setting headers across HTTP and WS clients ([#799](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/814)).

## [v0.11.0] - 2022-04-21

v0.11.0 is a breaking release that reworks how subscriptions are handled by the servers where the users have to explicitly reject or accept each subscription.
The reason for this is that the actual params in the subscription is passed to the callback and if the application decides the params are invalid and the server can't know if the call is going to fail or pass when dispatching the call.
Thus, the actual subscription method call is only answered when the subscription is accepted or rejected.

Additionally, the servers before sent a `SubscriptionClosed message` which is now disabled by default because it might break other implementations.
It is still possible to respond with a `SubscriptionClosed message` but one has to match on the result from `SubscriptionSink::pipe_from_stream`.

This release also adds support for `JSON-RPC WASM client` using web-sys bindings.

### [Added]
- feat: WASM client via web-sys transport [#648](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/648)

v0.10.1 is a release that fixes a regression in the HTTP server where the backlog was hardcoded to 128 (this is now set to 1024 by default but also configurable), introduces a couple of new APIs and a few minor bug fixes.

If your usage expects a high rate of new HTTP connections you are encouraged to update or manually configure the socket based on the traffic characteristics.

Yanked due to a leak when closing subscriptions in WebSocket server.

## [v0.9.0] - 2022-02-03

v0.9.0 is technically a breaking release because of the `Debug` bound of the `IdProvider` trait changed which is used by WebSocket server. In practise it should be a non-breaking upgrade for most users.

### [Changed]

v0.8.0 is a breaking release for the way subscription closing is handled, along with a few other minor tweaks and fixes.

### [Added]

- feat(client): support request id as Strings. [#659](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/659)
- feat(rpc module) Add a method to RpcModule that transforms the module into a RpcModule<()>, i.e. removes the context. [#660](https://github.com/paritytech/jsonrpsee/pull/660)

[changed] the proc macros are currently limited to client side.
