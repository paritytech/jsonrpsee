//! JSON-RPC clients, servers, and utilities.
//!
//! This crate allows you to perform outgoing JSON-RPC requests and creating servers accepting
//! JSON-RPC requests. Only [JSON-RPC version 2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is
//! supported.
//!
//! In addition to the core JSON-RPC specifications this crate also supports the non-standard
//! "JSON-RPC pub sub" extension, which allows the server to push notifications the client
//! subscribes to. This extension is most notably used in the Ethereum ecosystem, but it is very
//! generic and can be used for any purpose related or not to Ethereum.
//!
//! # Writing an API definition (optional)
//!
//! Before starting to perform or answer queries, one optional step is to define your JSON-RPC API
//! using the `rpc_api!` macro.
